# Old to New Groups Converter

This Python application is designed to convert old group formats to new group formats and retrieve new groups based on a mapping file. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface built using the Tkinter library.

## Features

- Convert old group format to new group format
- Load an old-to-new group mapping file
- Get new groups based on the loaded mapping and provided old groups

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following packages installed:

1. **Python 3.x**: The application is written in Python, so you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. **tkinter**: The tkinter package is a part of the Python standard library and is used for building the graphical user interface (GUI).

If you don't have Python installed on your system, you can download it from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

3. Install the required packages by running the following command:

```
pip install tkinter
```

Note: If you are using Python 3.x on Windows, the `tkinter` package should already be installed.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the following command to start the application:

```
python main.py
```

3. The application window will open, displaying the graphical user interface.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform the desired operations, such as converting old group formats and loading the mapping file.
